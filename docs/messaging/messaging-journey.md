This document is for anyone who is considering running an experiment using any of the messaging systems available in Nimbus from inception to launch. 

## Message Design

Once an idea has been developed, the next step is designing the experiment message. A good place to begin is by looking into the available messaging capabilities through the [Experimenter: Messaging Surfaces](https://experimenter.info/messaging/messaging-surfaces/). Another helpful tool is using ASRouter to preview the different messaging surfaces (see [Using ASRouter Devtools[(https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/browser/components/newtab/content-src/asrouter/docs/debugging-docs.html)) The OMC team has vast experience with running these experiments and can provide feedback and answer any questions in the [#omc Slack channel](https://mozilla.slack.com/archives/G90HG2UQH). 

## Running an Experiment
First, determine if your experiment will require any on-train development work to support the launch as well as any translated strings that need to land prior. Once thatâ€™s been determined, we can get started with creating the experiment, for a more in-depth guide and step by step process, visit OMC:Experimenter onboarding
