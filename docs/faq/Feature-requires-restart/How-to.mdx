# Is this supported in experiments?
This is how it works when a feature requires a restart:
* session 1: client enrolls, applies feature configuration, but the feature itself won't implement the changes until the next restart
* session 2: client is enrolled, feature configuration is applied, feature now shows changes

IMPORTANT:  Share that this experiment needs a restart in your data science Jira ticket and that there is custom work needed at analysis to exlude the pre-restart data.
