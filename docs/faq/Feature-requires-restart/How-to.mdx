# Features that need a restart
## What to know
This is how it works when a feature requires a restart:
* session 1: client enrolls, applies feature configuration, but the feature itself won't implement the changes until the next restart
* session 2: client is enrolled, feature configuration is applied, feature now shows changes

IMPORTANT:  Share that this experiment needs a restart in your data science Jira ticket!!  And that there is custom work needed at analysis to not count the pre-restart data.
