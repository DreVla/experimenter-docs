# Re-enrolled in the same experiment?
## Question
If a client is unenrolled from an experiment (say they opt out of that experiment specifically) will they be able to enroll again if they meet the criteria?

ANSWER: No, once a user is disqualified by opting out or through targeting, etc. the client keeps a record of that and won't enroll back into the same experiment
