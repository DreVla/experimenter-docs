## If the metrics you need doesnâ€™t exist already (in Core Metrics or Outcomes)?

After completing your experiment brief and defining your learning goals - go through the steps below until the metrics needed for this experiment are covered.  You do not need to complete all the steps - just enough to answer your questions.

**Step 1** - Check  [here](https://experimenter.info/jetstream/metrics/#how-do-i-add-a-metric-to-my-experiment) to learn if the existing Guardrail/Core metrics or Outcomes will answer your questions.

**Step 2** - Did an experiment run previously had these metrics you need?  
* Look at previous experiments in your feature area - do those metrics meet your needs?  Re-using metrics is a much quicker than writing from scratch.   
* If yes, create a [DO Jira ticket](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DO/boards/269) including:  
  * the link to your current experiment 
  * the link to the previous experiment(s) results.  Specify with of the metrics from the previous experiment you are interested in.    
* OPTIONAL: If you will want these metrics for future experiments on this feature - ask to have an Outcome added in addition to (or instead of) a custom config file.  Adding an Outcome means these metrics will become available to select from the Outcome drop down in Metrics.  

**Step 3** - Provide information to create a custom metric for this experiment.
* Create a [DO Jira ticket](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DO/boards/269) including: 
  * the link to your current experiment  
  * the questions you need to answer about the feature (that aren't covered by metrics from step 1 or step 2)
  * the specific telemetry probes in your feature that will be used to answer the question - including the possible values those probes collect and when they are sent.
* A data scientist needs to create a custom jetstream config file to add these metrics, so ask for an estimate for those to be created (varies based on complexity and people available).
