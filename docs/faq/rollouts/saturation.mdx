### Question
I have a feature that is now **on by default** in the current version.  I want to wait until it has saturated the user base before shutting off the rollout. Do we have a standard around how long we should keep a rollout going in a situation like this?

### Answer
**Yes**, we typically wait 1-3 releases after the release your change landed in the tree.  You'll have the vast majority on the next release cycle.  If you leave it on 1,2, or 3 releases depends on the ramifications if people have it enabled (through the rollout) on versions before you landed it, and then lose it.

If it's **not** a big deal, turn off the rollout in 1-3 releases. Most people will have it and the stragglers will get it when they upgrade.  If it **is** a big deal (think high impact security fix or crasher) - you can leave the rollout running longer.  You reach fewer people with each release, a percent or less each release for the stragglers.
