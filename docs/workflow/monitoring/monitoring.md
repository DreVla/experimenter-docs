Once your experiment has launched, from your experimenter page you will now have a "Live Monitoring Dashboard" link on the left hand gray sidebar.  

When to check here:
1. Soon after launch, check that your experiment is enrolling users as you'd expect.
2. Anytime during your experiment you can check that you don't have excessive unenrollments.
3. Before you Close Enrollment, check that you enrolled the amount of users expected.

What the different charts mean:
1. **Cummulative Population Estimate** is the total number of people enrolled in your experiment.  This is the chart you most frequently use.
